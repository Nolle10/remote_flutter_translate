# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided only for the most recent MAJOR.MINOR release. We do not backport security patches to earlier versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately using GitHub Security Advisories for this repository. If you cannot use Security Advisories, open a regular issue and label it as a security report, and a maintainer will follow up for details.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will respond as quickly as possible.
